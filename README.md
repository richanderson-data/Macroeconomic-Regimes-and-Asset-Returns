# Macroeconomic-Regimes-and-Asset-Returns
This project presents an empirical macro-finance analysis examining how U.S. interest-rate and inflation regimes relate to equity and fixed-income asset behavior. Rather than relying on narrative or political classifications, regimes are defined quantitatively using historical Federal Reserve data.
